# Getting started with this Project:-
This project was really fun to complete and i really learn a lot of things like understanding the Python Flask for generating the servers for my file to run on Web-Browser.

# Step 1:-
You need to download the project files from my Github and open the folder that you extracted into your favourite IDE. For myself i've used VSCODE.

# Step 2:-
Run the pip and locate to the directory where the Python app.py is present after comming in the directory just run the command Python "app.py".

# Step 3:-
Enjoy using my project.

# About the technologies and the code:-
This project uses the React and HTML and CSS and JSS for frontend part but if we talk about the backend i've written the Dijkstra algorithm in C++ language. As we all know that Dijkstra algorithm is one of the best algorithm for generating the minimum path between source and destination points.

Here in this project i've generated the graph (all the driver code is writen from scratch) the graph is represented the path of Hyderabad Metro Lines and all the stations.

Here for finding the path between the path i've encountered and maped the respective stations in three sections like the lined of the metro lines like (Red, Green, Blue), and even mapped the numbers accourding to the number and the stations and even connect the stations with each others using the HYD Metro Map by the formation of the graph.

Once the graph is ready to build then i've developed the Dijistra function and passes the required parameters 
were source and destination that is inputed by the user from the list and writen a normal logic like how dijistra algorithm really works and the output is stored in the respected vector and the using the map i've replaced those number to the names of the stations evem showen the metro line weither is RED, GREEN or BLUE accourding to the respective mapping.
